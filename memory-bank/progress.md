# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Backtracking Algorithm**: The main backtracking function is implemented and working
- **Object Model**: The Item class is functional with proper attributes
- **Game Constants**: Basic game constants are defined
- **Code Quality**: The code now passes flake8 linting checks
- **Documentation**: Basic docstrings have been added to major components

## What's Left to Build
- **Unit Tests**: No tests currently exist to verify algorithm correctness
- **Usage Examples**: Need examples showing how to use the algorithm
- **Performance Benchmarking**: No current way to measure algorithm efficiency
- **Alternative Algorithms**: Only backtracking is implemented; other approaches could be explored
- **Visualization**: No visualization of the algorithm's results or process
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Currently only optimizes for a single objective (weight)

## Current Status
The project is in an early stage with a functional but basic implementation. Recent improvements have focused on code quality and documentation rather than extending functionality.

### Completed Work
- Fixed all linting issues in the backtracking algorithm
- Added proper docstrings to the module and classes
- Established a memory bank system for project documentation

### In Progress
- Improving overall documentation of the project
- Considering next functional enhancements

### Upcoming Work
- Implement unit tests to verify correctness
- Create example usage scenarios
- Explore performance optimizations

## Known Issues
- The algorithm has exponential time complexity for large datasets
- No error handling for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs)
- No optimization for memory usage

## Evolution of Project Decisions
The project has evolved from a basic implementation to a more well-documented and linting-compliant codebase. The focus has shifted toward code quality and maintainability before further functional expansion.
