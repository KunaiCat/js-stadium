# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Knapsack Algorithm**: The main optimization function is implemented and working
- **JSON Data Processing**: Loading items from a JSON file is working correctly
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The system can run multiple budget test cases
- **Performance Timing**: Execution time measurement is implemented
- **Object Model**: The Item class is functional with proper attributes
- **Game Constants**: Basic game constants are defined
- **Code Quality**: The code passes flake8 linting checks
- **Documentation**: Basic docstrings have been added to major components

## What's Left to Build
- **Improved Output Format**: Currently only outputs price, not the full item list
- **Error Handling**: Need robust error handling for file loading and edge cases
- **Visualization**: No visualization of the algorithm's results or process
- **Unit Tests**: No formal tests currently exist to verify algorithm correctness
- **User Interface**: No user-friendly interface for running the algorithm
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Currently only optimizes for a single objective (weight)
- **Result Caching**: No caching mechanism for improved performance with similar inputs

## Current Status
The project has evolved from a basic algorithm implementation to a functional system that can load real game data and run optimizations with performance measurements. Recent improvements have focused on practical application rather than just theoretical implementation.

### Completed Work
- Implemented JSON data loading and processing
- Created a main function to run test cases
- Added timing measurements for performance tracking
- Renamed functions for clarity (_find_optimal_items_backtrack â†’ knapsack)
- Modified algorithm to work with item lists rather than dictionaries
- Set up multiple budget test scenarios

### In Progress
- Improving the output format to provide more detailed information
- Enhancing error handling for edge cases
- Exploring performance optimizations

### Upcoming Work
- Add visualization of selected items
- Implement result caching for performance improvement
- Create a more user-friendly interface

## Known Issues
- The algorithm has exponential time complexity for large datasets
- No error handling for invalid JSON data or file access issues
- Output format is minimal, only showing total price, not the selected items
- No optimization for memory usage

## Evolution of Project Decisions
The project has evolved from a theoretical algorithm implementation to a practical application with real game data. The focus has shifted toward usability and performance measurement while maintaining code quality and documentation standards.
