# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Our current focus is on the practical application of the knapsack algorithm to game item optimization. Recent work includes:

1. Added JSON data processing functionality:
   - Implemented loading and parsing of items from a JSON file
   - Added support for processing real game item data with multiple attributes

2. Enhanced algorithm implementation:
   - Renamed the function from _find_optimal_items_backtrack to knapsack for clarity
   - Modified to work directly with item lists rather than dictionaries
   - Added performance measurement for execution time tracking

3. Added testing capabilities:
   - Implemented a main function to run the algorithm with different budget cases
   - Added timing measurements to evaluate performance
   - Set up multiple budget test scenarios

## Recent Changes
- Expanded the function to work with real game data from items.json
- Added performance timing to track algorithm efficiency
- Integrated with test cases to evaluate multiple budget scenarios
- Created a proper main function with file loading and result display
- Added docstrings and comments throughout the implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Short-term priorities**:
   - Improve the output format to provide more detailed information
   - Enhance error handling for file loading and data processing
   - Add visualization of selected items for each budget case
   - Implement result caching for improved performance

2. **Medium-term goals**:
   - Create a more user-friendly interface for running the algorithm
   - Implement alternative algorithms for comparison
   - Add support for multi-objective optimization
   - Develop comprehensive test suite with more scenarios

3. **Long-term vision**:
   - Create a web interface for interacting with the algorithm
   - Develop a more comprehensive optimization framework
   - Support real-time optimization for game clients
   - Add machine learning to predict optimal loadouts based on player preferences

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using JSON for data storage provides flexibility for adding new items
- Performance testing helps identify potential bottlenecks
- The algorithm needs to be efficient enough for real-time use in a game context
- Multiple test cases help validate algorithm effectiveness across different scenarios

## Important Patterns and Preferences
