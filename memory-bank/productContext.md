# Product Context

## Problem Domain
The js-stadium project addresses the common optimization problem of selecting a set of items with various properties to maximize utility within given constraints. This is a variant of the knapsack problem, which has applications in resource allocation, inventory management, and decision optimization.

## Use Cases
1. **Resource Allocation**: Determining the optimal allocation of limited resources
2. **Inventory Management**: Selecting items to include in an inventory with space or budget constraints
3. **Investment Decisions**: Choosing a portfolio of investments that maximizes returns within a budget

## User Experience Goals
1. Provide accurate and optimal solutions to constraint-based problems
2. Enable efficient decision-making through algorithmic approaches
3. Maintain clarity through well-documented code that explains the methodology

## Value Proposition
This implementation offers a solution to complex decision problems through a backtracking algorithm approach. The code's value lies in its ability to find optimal combinations when brute force approaches would be computationally impractical.

## Intended Audience
- Developers implementing resource optimization algorithms
- Data scientists working on constraint-based problems
- Students learning algorithmic approaches to optimization problems

## Success Metrics
1. Algorithm correctness (finding truly optimal solutions)
2. Performance efficiency (solving problems in reasonable time)
3. Code clarity and maintainability
