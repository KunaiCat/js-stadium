# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in the implementation
- **Type Hints (typing module)**: Used for improved code clarity and static type checking
- **Flake8**: Linting tool used for code quality enforcement

## Development Environment
- **Windows**: Development appears to be on a Windows 10 environment
- **Git**: Version control system used for the project
- **Terminal**: Git Bash is used as the shell for command execution

## Coding Standards
- **PEP 8**: Python code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Docstrings**: Documentation follows standard Python docstring format
- **Type Annotations**: Functions and classes use type hints for better clarity

## Project Structure
The project has a simple structure:
- `backtracking_algorithm.py`: Core implementation of the backtracking algorithm
- Future expansion may include additional algorithm implementations

## Dependencies
Currently minimal dependencies:
- Standard Python libraries
- `typing` module for type annotations
- `flake8` for code quality checking

## Development Workflow
1. Code implementation with proper type annotations
2. Linting with flake8 to ensure code quality
3. Documentation with docstrings
4. Version control with Git

## Technical Constraints
- Performance is constrained by the exponential nature of the backtracking algorithm
- The maximum number of items in inventory is limited to 10 items
- Currently implemented for single-objective optimization (maximizing weight)

## Future Technical Considerations
- Potential migration to more efficient algorithms for larger datasets
- Possible introduction of multi-objective optimization techniques
- Consideration for parallel processing for performance improvements
