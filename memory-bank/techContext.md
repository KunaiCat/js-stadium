# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in the implementation
- **Type Hints (typing module)**: Used for improved code clarity and static type checking
- **Flake8**: Linting tool used for code quality enforcement
- **JSON**: Used for storing and loading item data
- **time module**: Used for performance measurement

## Development Environment
- **Windows**: Development appears to be on a Windows 10 environment
- **Git**: Version control system used for the project
- **Terminal**: Git Bash is used as the shell for command execution
- **GitHub**: Remote repository hosting at KunaiCat/js-stadium

## Coding Standards
- **PEP 8**: Python code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Docstrings**: Documentation follows standard Python docstring format
- **Type Annotations**: Functions and classes use type hints for better clarity
- **Performance Tracking**: Code includes timing measurements for performance analysis

## Project Structure
The project has evolved to include:
- `backtracking_algorithm.py`: Core implementation with knapsack algorithm and main function
- `items.json`: Comprehensive data file containing all item definitions
- `memory-bank/`: Documentation and project context
- `.cursorrules`: Project coding standards and patterns

## Dependencies
Current dependencies:
- Standard Python libraries:
  - `json`: For parsing item data from JSON
  - `time`: For measuring algorithm performance
  - `typing`: For type annotations

## Development Workflow
1. Load data from JSON files
2. Apply algorithm to the data with various test cases
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Document findings and update project documentation

## Technical Constraints
- Performance is constrained by the exponential nature of the backtracking algorithm
- The maximum number of items in inventory is limited to 10 items
- Currently optimizes for a single objective (maximizing weight)
- Processing large JSON datasets may impact initial load times

## Future Technical Considerations
- Potential caching of intermediate results to improve performance
- Parallel processing for testing multiple budget scenarios simultaneously
- More sophisticated data visualization for result analysis
- Web interface for interacting with the algorithm and viewing results
