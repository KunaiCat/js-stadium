# Project Brief: js-stadium

## Project Overview
This project implements an optimization algorithm in Python for finding the best combination of items within a budget constraint to maximize total weight. It appears to be related to a game inventory system, where items have prices and weights, and the goal is to select items that provide the maximum benefit while staying within a budget. The project name "js-stadium" suggests it might be connected to a larger game ecosystem.

## Core Requirements
1. Maintain a clean, well-documented codebase
2. Ensure algorithms are efficient and correctly implemented
3. Fix code issues while preserving functionality
4. Process item data from JSON files
5. Support multiple budget test cases

## Project Goals
1. Create a system that can find optimal item combinations given budget constraints
2. Implement efficient algorithms for resource optimization problems
3. Provide clear documentation for all components
4. Process real-world item data from structured JSON sources
5. Measure and report algorithm performance

## Current Status
The project currently contains:
1. A backtracking algorithm (renamed to "knapsack") that finds optimal items given a budget constraint
2. A main function to load items from a JSON file and run test cases with different budgets
3. Performance measurement for each test case
4. A comprehensive items.json file with game item data including various attributes
5. Documentation and memory bank for project tracking

## Next Steps
1. Further optimize the algorithm for performance with large datasets
2. Add more comprehensive testing beyond the current test cases
3. Consider implementing alternative algorithms for comparison
4. Add visualization of the selected items
5. Create a more user-friendly interface for running optimizations
