# Project Brief: js-stadium

## Project Overview
This project appears to be focused on an optimization algorithm implemented in Python, despite the repository name suggesting JavaScript. The core functionality involves a backtracking algorithm that finds optimal items based on constraints like budget and weight.

## Core Requirements
1. Maintain a clean, well-documented codebase
2. Ensure algorithms are efficient and correctly implemented
3. Fix code issues while preserving functionality

## Project Goals
1. Create a system that can find optimal item combinations given constraints
2. Implement efficient algorithms for resource optimization problems
3. Provide clear documentation for all components

## Current Status
The project currently contains a backtracking algorithm in Python that finds optimal items given a budget constraint, optimizing for total weight. The code has recently been refactored to fix linting issues and improve documentation.

## Next Steps
1. Further document the codebase
2. Potentially expand functionality
3. Consider performance optimizations
4. Evaluate implementation of additional algorithms
